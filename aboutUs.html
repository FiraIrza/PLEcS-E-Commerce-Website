                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>Puff Lab was founded by Mdm Azizah Sayan binti Lukman Hakim and Grace Chong in the year of 2019 and
                    completed its legal establishment in 2020. Mr Yazid Rizman (CEO) join them a slightly time later.
                    The business started off with a dedication to making the perfect cream puff with just one permanent
                    staff member, enhanced by a group of about ten students working part-time, who made up the most of
                    the workforce.</p>
